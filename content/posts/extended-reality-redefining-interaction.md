Extended Reality (XR), encompassing Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), is breaking free from its entertainment origins and finding diverse applications in 2023. Healthcare professionals are leveraging AR for surgical precision, educators are using VR for immersive learning experiences, and businesses are incorporating MR for virtual collaboration.

XR blurs the lines between the digital and physical worlds, creating novel ways to interact with information and environments. This year showcases the transformative potential of XR beyond gaming, making it a technology to watch across industries.
