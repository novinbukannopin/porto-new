One is a simple Food Recipe App and the other is COVID-19 Data App.\r\nTurned out it was so fun.\r\n\r\n## 1. Le Cook\r\n\r\nFun food recipe catalog app powered by [RecipePuppy](https://recipepuppy.com) API....\r\n\r\n[https://le-cook.now.sh/](https://le-cook.now.sh/)\r\n\r\n![Le Cook (1)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/le-cook_1.jpg)\r\n![Le Cook (2)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/le-cook_2.jpg)\r\n![Le Cook (3)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/le-cook_3.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 2. COVID-19 Data\r\n\r\npresenting COVID-19 statistics powered by [@mathdroid](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api/)'s covid-19-api.\r\nI made a vanilla JS version of this app several days ago and I decided to re-develop it using Gatsby (React).\r\n\r\n[https://covid19data.now.sh/](https://covid19data.now.sh/)\r\n\r\n![COVID-19 Data App (1)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/covid19data_1.jpg)\r\n![COVID-19 Data App (2)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/covid19data_2.jpg)\r\n![COVID-19 Data App (3)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/covid19data_3.jpg)\r\n\r\nBoth [Le Cook](https://le-cook.now.sh/) and [COVID-19 Data](https://covid19data.now.sh/) app were developed using Segment's Evergreen UI. Just discovered this React UI Framework and turns out it's so convenient to implement it on these projects.\r\n\r\nWhen developing COVID-19 Data app, I realized Evergreen UI have no opinionated way to construct responsive layouts. So, I decided to combine it with TailwindCSS which I already tried to use at this personal site. It worked.\r\n\r\n![Evergreen UI (1)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_1.jpg)\r\n![Evergreen UI (2)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_2.jpg)\r\n![Evergreen UI (3)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_3.jpg)\r\n![Evergreen UI (4)](https://sznm.dev/images/2020-05-02-self-challenge/evergreen-ui_4.jpg)\r\n\r\nI decided to deploy it using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and I'm so shocked by how fast it is compared to [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I'm considering to migrate to Vercel from Netlify for my previous projects, including this site.\r\n\r\nI posted my recent projects [here](https://sznm.dev/projects).\r\nYou can access the project and the project's GitHub repository link from this [page](https://sznm.dev/projects).\r\n",
